This is the README file for the matrix multiplication code.

1. sequential/ :
	This folder contains the makefile, scripts and binary for the matrix multiplication
	that is implemented sequentially.
	Execute the command: make clean && make in this folder to compile the scripts

2. omp/ :
	This folder contains the makefile, scripts for the speed-up matrix multiplication
	using the OMP pragmas.
	Execute the command: make clean && make to generate the binary.

Running the tests:
1. Use the command "./matrix_mul -i ../matrix_mul_01.dat -o" and 
   "./matrix_mul -i ../matrix_mul_02.dat -o" in each of the above two folders to execute
   and see the performance in terms of execution times.
